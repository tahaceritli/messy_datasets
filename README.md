# Messy Datasets
This repo contains various messy csv files and their type annotations, such as integer number, date, etc. Some of these datasets already appeared in papers, and could be useful for using in experiments as 'benchmark' data.

In the files directory, we present a folder for each dataset, consisting of three parts: (i) a data file, (ii) a type annotation file, (iii) and a meta-data folder (hopefully).
