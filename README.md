# Messy Datasets
This repo contains various messy csv files, some of which already appeared in papers, and could be useful for using in experiments as 'benchmark' data.

We also provide type annotations, such as integer number, date, etc., and meta-data.

In the files directory, we present a folder for each dataset, consisting of three parts: (i) a data file, (ii) a type annotation file, (iii) and a meta-data folder (hopefully).
