# Messy Datasets
This repo contains various messy csv files, some of which already appeared in papers making them suitable to be used in experiments as 'benchmark' data.

We also provide type annotations and meta-data for each dataset.

You can find the aforementioned information under the directory named 'files', consisting of three parts:
- a data file, 
- a type annotation file, 
- a meta-data folder (hopefully).
